          Pokémon is a series of video games developed by Game Freak and
          published by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company as part of the Pokémon
          media franchise. Created by Satoshi Tajiri with assistance from Ken
          Sugimori,the first games released in 1996 in Japan for the Game Boy,
          and the main series of role-playing video games (RPGs), also referred
          as the "core series" by their developers

            Water is one of the three basic elemental types along with Fire and
            Grass, which constitute the three starter Pokémon. This creates a
            simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new players.
            Water is the most common type with over 100 Pokémon, which are based
            on a wide variety of fish and other sea-dwelling creatures.

            Fire is one of the three basic elemental types along with Water and
            Grass, which constitute the three starter Pokémon. This creates a
            simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new players.
            Fire types are notoriously rare in the early stages of the games so
            choosing the Fire variation starter is often a plus.

            simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new
            players.Grass is one of the weakest types statistically, with 5
            defensive weaknesses and 7 types that are resistant to Grass moves.

            The AR game's potential for weight loss was a big part of that
            discussion. In the process of getting out their doors and visiting
            parks, players found they were losing weight almost in spite of
            themselves. A Reddit Pokémon Go fan won acclaim for reporting that
            he'd lost 65 pounds between July and December.

          Questions Every Pokemon Trainer Should Be Able To Answer
        </p>
        <ol>
          <h2>
            <li><a href="#"></a> What Pokemon does Pikachu evolve into?</li>
          </h2>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="#"></a> 
              We're sure you know this Electric mouse Pokemon, and you know it
              quite well. Basic knowledge of Pikachu is essential for every
              trainer, but you should also be well versed in the rodent's
              evolutionary chain. Pikachu, mighty as it is, has an even
              stronger evolved form also capable of generating vast amounts of
              electricity. Maybe you've bumped into this species in the wild.
              Either way, this is a question all Pokemon trainers should be
              able to answer.
            </li>
            <li><a href="#"></a> Answer is Raichu</li>

          </h2>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="#"></a> 
              Not all Poke Balls are made equally. There's the basic model you
              start your journey off with, but progressive upgrades are needed
              if you're looking to keep up with some of the stronger wild
              Pokemon who emerge in later routes. If you've made your way
              through any Pokemon game, you've reached the point where you're
              presented with the most effective Poke Ball known to man. This
              is a one shot catch, and no button mashing at all is required.

            Pokémon battles appear in most forms of Pokémon media, being the

            Pokémon Go's Types are exactly the same as those in the main
            Pokémon games, but the effect of those type matchups is slightly
            different: in brief, things like effective or resisted attacks
            have slightly different multipliers to the main Pokémon games -
            although a December 2018 update brought them slightly closer in
            line.

            "Charizard is an orange draconic Pokémon who has a fiery temper.
            It is the final evolution of Charmander, one of the starter
            Pokémon for the original game. Pokedex says: Charizard flies
            around the sky in search of powerful opponents. It breathes fire
            of such great heat that it melts anything. However, it never turns
            its fiery breath on any opponent weaker than itself. "

            The original Pokémon games are Japanese role-playing video games (RPGs) with an element of strategy, and
            were created by Satoshi Tajiri for the Game Boy. The Pokémon series began with the release of Pocket
            Monsters Red and Green for the Game Boy in Japan. When these games proved popular, an enhanced Blue version
            was released sometime after, and the Blue version was reprogrammed as Pokémon Red and Blue for international
            release. The original Green version was not released outside Japan
